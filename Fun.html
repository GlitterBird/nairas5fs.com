      <h2 class="head-center">Reading</h2>
      <p class="center">I like reading; sometimes I stay up for half the night reading a book if it's really good. Moreover, reading always cheers me up, no matter what I'm doing. I like both fiction and nonfiction books and series which I borrow from the Milpitas Library. It's been pretty hard knowing which books are good and which ones aren't during this pandemic, since I can't really open them and preview them before I check them out. Moreover, I also like reading magazines and articles online, as long as they're based on something interesting.</p>

      <h2 class="head-center">Watching TV</h2>
      <p class="center">I really enjoy watching TV. So far, shows that I've watched include iCarly, Survivor, The Office, Doraemon(a japanese TV show), You vs. Wild, The Amazing Race(I love this show; I hope I get to go on it someday), The Flash(I'm still watching it) and a bit of Naruto.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div">
      <h2 class="head-center">Debating</h2>
      <p class="center">Another hobby of mine is debating. There are many divisions of debate, and I debate in LD which stands for Lincoln Douglas and is one vs. one. It's a lot of fun, especially since I like debating. Each round lasts for about 45 minutes, with both competitors giving their speeches. The image below is me during a recent debate round debating the topic of "The United States ought to implement universal child care".</p>
